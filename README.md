Template for creating a simple interactive 3D map using MapBox SDK

*"like Photoshop, for maps. We give designers control over everything from colors and fonts, 
to 3D features and camera angles, to the pitch of the map as a car enters a turn." - MapBox*

The template will help you immediately create a simple map, and you can adjust the values in a couple of the lines for your own projects.
