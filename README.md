Template for creating a simple interactive 3D map using MapBox SDK

I wanted to create an interactive resume experience on my personal website so I downloaded MapBox Studio. 
MapBox Studio is "like Photoshop, for maps. We give designers control over everything from colors and fonts, 
to 3D features and camera angles, to the pitch of the map as a car enters a turn." - MapBox

It is fairly straightforward to use and the capabilities of the API and SDK they offer are incredible.
The template will help you immediately create a simple map, and you can adjust the values in a couple of the lines for your own projects.
