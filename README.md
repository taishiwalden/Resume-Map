Template for creating a simple interactive 3D map using MapBox SDK

"like Photoshop, for maps. We give designers control over everything from colors and fonts, 
to 3D features and camera angles, to the pitch of the map as a car enters a turn." - MapBox

The template will help you immediately create a simple map, and you can adjust the values in a couple of the lines for your own projects.
